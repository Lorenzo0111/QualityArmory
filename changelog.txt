	Fixed problems where guns could be duplicated though dropping, shiftclicking, right clicking, dragging, dieing, swapping items, or off-hand-toggling when reloading.

	Fixed textures and models for the Enfield, Henry Rifle, and MouserC96.
	Recreated the M40 rifle. With the addition of ironsights, the model of the scope needed to change, as the old model only had a flat texture for the lense.

	Automatic fire has been added for weapons that do not have iron sights. Must have iron sights enabled to enable this feature. Currently, this is just the MP5K and the AK47.

	Implemented system to 'break' reloading guns if they are glitched. Even if a new update will change something so guns can be duplicated, the guns should no longer work.
	Fixed gun lists for commands. They now support guns with spaces in their names.
	Reduced gun class sizes.
	*Added framework for new gun additions. New gun or more gun customization to come in the next update.
