    ****   MASSIVE UPDATE  ****
    This update changes the models used for weapons. In order to make it easier
    to integrate QA with other plugins, models now use Custom Model data tags.
    This means all user-made custom models used in previous versions will need to be upgraded
    Also, the base-item for 1.14+ has been changed to the crossbow, so the player's hand
    model will hold the gun. This does not affect 1.8-1.13, but should be noted for
    newer servers on 1.14.

    Also, because of this change, all weapons on 1.14 servers will no longer work.
    I recommend updating only if you wish remove all weapons from the server

    If you wish to use the old 1.13 system on 1.14 still, set "ManuallyOverrideTo_1_13_systems" to true in the config.

    If you wish to use the old 1.8 system on newer updates, set "ManuallyOverrideTo_1_8_systems" to true in the config.
